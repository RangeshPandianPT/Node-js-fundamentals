# 📚 The Node.js Learning Path Repository

This repository is a structured, comprehensive resource designed to guide aspiring and current developers through mastering **Node.js**. Whether you're building a REST API, a real-time application, or a command-line tool, this path will cover the essential concepts, best practices, and ecosystem tools you need to succeed.


-----

## 1\. Project Overview

**Node.js** is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a browser, primarily for server-side and networking applications.

This repository focuses on **hands-on learning** through code examples, practice exercises, and small project outlines, organized by topic for a clear, linear progression.

## 2\. Prerequisites

To get the most out of this learning path, you should have a solid understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts.

### Essential JavaScript Knowledge:

  * **Syntax and Data Structures:** Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`), Data Types (Strings, Numbers, Objects, Arrays).
  * **Functions:** Arrow functions, function expressions, and callbacks.
  * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JS:** Classes, Prototypes, and Inheritance.
  * **Modern JS Features (ES6+):** Destructuring, Spread/Rest operators, and Template Literals.

### System Requirements:

  * **Node.js:** Latest LTS version (e.g., Node.js 20.x or higher)
      * *Check your version:* `node -v`
  * **npm:** Node Package Manager (comes bundled with Node.js)
      * *Check your version:* `npm -v`
  * **Git:** For cloning and managing the repository.
  * A **Code Editor** (e.g., VS Code).

## 3\. Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the repository up and running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/node-js-learning-path.git
    cd node-js-learning-path
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Many of the sub-projects and examples will have their own `package.json` file. You may need to run `npm install` within the specific subdirectory of the topic you are working on.

    ```bash
    # Example: navigate to the Express.js section
    cd 05-Express-Framework-Basics
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run a starter file:**
    Test your installation with a simple file, for example, running `01-Core-Concepts/event_loop.js`.

    ```bash
    node 01-Core-Concepts/event_loop.js
    ```

## 4\. Core Learning Topics

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a fundamental Node.js topic.

| Directory | Topic | Key Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `01-Core-Concepts` | **Asynchronous Programming** | Event Loop, Callbacks, **Promises**, `async/await`, Non-Blocking I/O. |
| `02-Built-in-Modules` | **Standard Library** | `http` (creating a basic server), `fs` (File System), `path`, `os`, `util`. |
| `03-NPM-Packages` | **Package Management** | `package.json`, dependencies, `npm install`, **scripting**, global vs. local packages. |
| `04-Streams-Buffers` | **Data Handling** | **Buffers** (binary data), **Streams** (Readable, Writable, Duplex), efficient large file handling. |
| `05-Express-Framework` | **Web Servers & APIs** | Setting up **Express.js**, Routing, Middleware, Request/Response cycle. |
| `06-Database-Integration` | **Persistence Layer** | Connecting to **MongoDB** (via Mongoose) and/or **SQL** (via Sequelize/Prisma), CRUD operations. |
| `07-Authentication` | **Security** | **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, Session-based auth, Hashing passwords (Bcrypt). |
| `08-Advanced-Topics` | **Scaling & Architecture** | Unit Testing (Jest), Deployment concepts, Environment Variables (`dotenv`). |

## 6\. Usage & Examples

Each topic directory contains examples that demonstrate the concept. To run any file, use the `node` command from your terminal:

```bash
# Example 1: Run a basic HTTP server file
cd 02-Built-in-Modules
node http_server.js
# The server will likely start at http://localhost:3000

# Example 2: Run an async/await file
cd 01-Core-Concepts
node async_await_demo.js
```
